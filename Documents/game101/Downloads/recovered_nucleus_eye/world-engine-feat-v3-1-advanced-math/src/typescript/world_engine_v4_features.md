    mixed_precision=True        # NEW V4.0
)

# Initialize V4.0 model
model = WorldEngineV4(config)

# Create production trainer
trainer = WorldEngineV4Trainer(model, config)

# Multi-modal training example
batch = {
    'token_ids': text_tokens,
    'audio_input': audio_features,    # NEW V4.0
    'visual_input': visual_features,  # NEW V4.0
    'labels': target_labels

    text_features,
    torch.cat([audio_features, visual_features], dim=1),
    torch.cat([audio_features, visual_features], dim=1)
)

# Gated fusion
gate = self.fusion_gate(all_features)
fused = self.fusion_transform(all_features) * gate
```

### Adaptive Memory System
```python
# Intelligent memory replacement
combined_score = self.memory_usage + self.memory_age * 0.1
_, indices = torch.topk(combined_score, batch_size, largest=False)

# Store with importance weighting
self.memory_bank[indices] = features.detach()
self.memory_usage[indices] = importance.detach()
```

### ‚ö° **Animation System**
6 different animation patterns that transform your 4D structures:

- **Pulse** - Rhythmic expansion and contraction
- **Rotate** - Smooth orbital rotation around center point
- **Morph** - Dynamic shape-shifting transformations
- **Wave** - Flowing wave motion across the structure
- **Spiral** - Hypnotic spiral patterns with increasing complexity
- **Bloom** - Organic growth and expansion effects

- **Link Mode**: Connect nodes between back and front walls
- **Preview Window**: Real-time composite view of all layers

## üéØ **Usage Examples**

### Creating a Glyph-Enhanced 4D Structure
1. Generate a radial graph on front wall
2. Select "Aurora Lattice" glyph
3. Set intensity to 75%
4. Apply glyph to create prismatic effects
5. Start "Spiral" animation for dynamic movement

### Building an Animated 4D Scene
1. Create grid on back wall (7x10)
2. Create radial on front wall (4 rings, 8 per ring)
3. Use Link Mode to connect corresponding nodes
4. Select "Bloom" animation with speed 50
5. Apply "Kintsugi Field" glyph for golden mending effects

### Interactive Glyph Painting
1. Set up any 4D structure
2. Select desired glyph effect
3. Adjust intensity for desired strength
4. Click multiple locations to paint glyph effects
5. Watch particle systems interact with animated geometry

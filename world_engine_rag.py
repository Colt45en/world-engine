            # Troubleshooting and Support
            Document(
                page_content="""
Common World Engine issues and solutions:

Import Errors: Use modern LangChain namespaces (langchain-core, langchain-community,
langchain-huggingface) instead of legacy imports.

Python Environment: Configure virtual environment with Python 3.12+ and install
required packages: sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, langchain packages.

3D Rendering Issues: Check WebGL support, ensure Three.js is properly loaded,
verify camera position and controls initialization.

Component Communication: Use World Engine Bridge system for data sharing,
check subscription state and hook implementations.

Performance Optimization: Enable hardware acceleration, optimize 3D models,
use efficient rendering techniques and memory management.

The RAG system provides contextual help and can retrieve specific solutions
based on error messages and system state analysis.

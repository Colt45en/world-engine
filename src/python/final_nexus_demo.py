                Great question! PDNF conversion is like following a recipe - once you know the steps, it becomes much easier. Let me guide you through converting A·(B+C') to PDNF:

                🔹 Step 1: Distribute the expression
                   A·(B+C') = A·B + A·C'

                🔹 Step 2: Check if each term has all variables (A, B, C)
                   - A·B is missing variable C
                   - A·C' is missing variable B

                🔹 Step 3: Add missing variables using the identity X + X' = 1
                   - A·B becomes A·B·(C+C') = A·B·C + A·B·C'
                   - A·C' becomes A·C'·(B+B') = A·B·C' + A·B'·C'

                🔹 Step 4: Combine all terms
                   Final PDNF: A·B·C + A·B·C' + A·B'·C'

                Excellent question! The difference between PDNF and PCNF is like the difference between addition and multiplication at a higher level:

                🎯 PDNF (Principal Disjunctive Normal Form):
                   • "Sum of Products" format: (term1) + (term2) + (term3)
                   • Each term contains ALL variables
                   • Example: A·B·C + A·B'·C' + A'·B·C

                🎯 PCNF (Principal Conjunctive Normal Form):
                   • "Product of Sums" format: (clause1)·(clause2)·(clause3)
                   • Each clause contains ALL variables
                   • Example: (A+B+C)·(A+B'+C')·(A'+B+C)

                💡 Memory tip: Think "P-D-N-F = Plus (addition) between terms" and "P-C-N-F = Connect (multiply) clauses together"

const result = await framework.processWithAdvancedMorphology('counterproductivity');
// Returns: morphemes, complexity, classification, semantic vector
```

### Advanced Search:
```javascript
const results = await framework.searchWithIndexManager('machine learning', {
    useMorphology: true,
    maxResults: 10
});
// Returns: ranked results with BM25 scores and vector similarity
```

### Comprehensive Processing:
```javascript
const response = await framework.processComprehensive('bioengineering systems', {
    enableMorphology: true,
    enableSearch: true,
    useAgents: true
});
// Returns: morphology, search results, UX processing, agent insights
```
